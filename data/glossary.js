  "example": "A survey of 1,000 Indore shoppers finds 44% would pay ₹50 extra for same-day delivery, with a 95% confidence interval of about 41% to 47%, so the true share among all shoppers is probably in that range, not exactly 44%.",

  "hindi": "वैनिशिंग और एक्सप्लोडिंग ग्रेडिएंट्स (गायब होते या बेकाबू ग्रेडिएंट)",
  "simple": "In deep networks, backpropagation multiplies many numbers together, one per layer, so the gradients reaching the early layers can shrink to almost zero (vanishing: those layers stop learning) or grow huge (exploding: training blows up). ReLU activations, careful starting weights, batch normalisation, skip connections (as in ResNet) and gradient clipping (capping the gradient's size) are the common fixes.",
  "example": "Like a rumour passed through 50 relatives at a wedding: by the last person it has either faded to nothing or grown wildly out of proportion.",

  "hindi": "वेक्टर (सदिश)",
  "simple": "An ordered list of numbers, like [age, income, visits], which can also be drawn as an arrow; the arrow's length is called the vector's norm. In ML, every data point, word or image ends up as a vector.",
  "example": "A customer can be stored as [32, 65000, 4]: 32 years old, ₹65,000 monthly income and 4 store visits this month.",

  "term": "Vector Database",
  "hindi": "वेक्टर डेटाबेस",
  "simple": "A database that stores embeddings and quickly finds the ones closest in meaning to the embedding of a question. Chroma is a free example, and FAISS is a free search library that is often used the same way.",
  "example": "Store the embeddings of a telecom company's 5,000 FAQ answers, and for each customer question fetch the 3 closest answers in milliseconds.",
